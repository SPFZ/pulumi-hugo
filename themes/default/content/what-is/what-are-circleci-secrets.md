[CircleCI](https://circleci.com/) is an agile Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) platform. It aims to automate software development processes for faster, more reliable releases. CircleCI secrets empower developers to safeguard critical data while streamlining workflows.

## What are CircleCI secrets?

CircleCI secrets are sensitive pieces of information that are necessary for building and deploying applications securely within your CI/CD pipeline. They can include things like API tokens, SSH keys, and environment variables that contain credentials. These are meant to be hidden from the public and even from certain team members to maintain security and integrity of the access they provide. In CircleCI, secrets are used within the configuration of continuous integration and delivery pipelines to allow automated processes to interact with other services, repositories, and infrastructure securely. Managing these secrets securely is crucial to prevent unauthorized access and potential security breaches.

### Key features

- **Seamless pipeline integration:** CircleCI secrets seamlessly integrate into all workflows, eliminating the need for complex setup. This built-in solution ensures automatic retrieval and management of credentials throughout the build, test, and deployment phases.
- **Environment variable flexibility:** CircleCI secrets can be easily referenced as environment variables across workflows. This flexibility allows a single codebase to cater to various development environments, including Dev, QA, pre-prod, etc.
- **Centralized version control:** CircleCI centralizes configuration files with secret references in the `.circleci` home directory. This approach removes the necessity of embedding sensitive data directly into your application. Safely commit CircleCI configurations alongside the application code for streamlined version control.
- **Native CircleCI tools for secrets management:** The [CircleCI CLI](https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/circleci-cli) and [CircleCI-Env-Inspector](https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/CircleCI-Env-Inspector) provide seamless support for secrets management. This includes the ability to effortlessly create, rotate, audit, and generate reportsâ€”all without the hassle of installing additional complex systems.

## Getting Started with CircleCI secrets

### Define a CircleCI secret via the CLI

Visit the [official installation page](https://circleci.com/docs/local-cli/) to complete the CLI Installation. Then, define a secret via the CLI as follows:

```bash
$ circleci api create-secret MY_PROJECT_NAME MY_ENV_VAR_NAME
```

### Reference secrets in CircleCI jobs

A CircleCI job is a collection of steps. You can leverage CircleCI secrets within your jobs to allow the pipeline to access confidential data without exposing it directly in the code. Here's a `.circleci/config.yml` file definition using a secret named `API_KEY` inside of a job:

```yaml
version: 2.1

jobs:
  build:
    docker:
      - image: circleci/python:3.8
    steps:
      - checkout
      # Your build steps here...
  test:
    docker:
      - image: circleci/node:18
    steps:
      - checkout
      # Your test steps here...
  deploy:
    docker:
      - image: circleci/python:3.8
    steps:
      - checkout
      # Deploy step that uses the secret
      - run:
          name: Deploy to Production
          command: |
            echo "Deploying to production..."
            # Use the API_KEY secret in your deployment script or command
            ./deploy_script.sh $API_KEY

workflows:
  version: 2
  build_and_deploy:
    jobs:
      - build
      - test
      - deploy:
          # Specify the API_KEY secret for the deploy job
          secrets:
            - API_KEY
```

In this example:

1. Three jobs are defined: `build`, `test`, and `deploy`.
2. The `deploy` job includes a deploy step that uses the `$API_KEY` secret. The secret is accessed securely without exposing its actual value in the configuration file.
3. The `build_and_deploy` workflow is defined to execute the `build`, `test`, and `deploy` jobs in sequence.
4. The `deploy` job is specified to use the `API_KEY` secret, ensuring that the secret is available for this specific job in the workflow.

This example illustrates how CircleCI secrets can be leveraged within jobs to securely access confidential data during different stages of your CI/CD pipeline. The secret is referenced in the job configuration without exposing its actual value in the code, enhancing security and maintaining best practices for sensitive information handling.

### Configure CircleCI workflows with secrets

A workflow is a set of rules for defining a collection of jobs and their run order. You can integrate CircleCI secrets into workflows by referencing them in the configuration files. This ensures your sensitive data remains secure while being accessible during the execution of CI/CD pipelines. For example, let's assume you have a secret named `API_KEY` that you've defined for your CircleCI project. In your `.circleci/config.yml` file, you can reference this secret within your workflow steps:

```yaml
version: 2.1

jobs:
  build:
    docker:
      - image: circleci/python:3.8
    steps:
      - checkout
      # Your build steps here...

workflows:
  version: 2
  build_and_deploy:
    jobs:
      - build
      # Deploy step that uses the secret
      - deploy:
          name: Deploy to Production
          command: |
            echo "Deploying to production..."
            # Use the API_KEY secret in your deployment script or command
            ./deploy_script.sh $API_KEY
```

In this example:

- The `build` job is defined with its necessary steps.
- The `build_and_deploy` workflow is defined, including the `build` job.
- A subsequent job, named `deploy`, is included in the workflow. This job may represent the deployment step of your CI/CD process.
- Inside the `deploy` job, you can reference the `API_KEY` secret by using the `$API_KEY` syntax. This allows you to securely pass the secret value to your deployment script or command.

Remember to adjust the job names, workflow structure, and secret references according to your specific project requirements. This example demonstrates the basic concept of integrating a CircleCI secret into your workflow by referencing it in the configuration file.

### Challenges and Considerations

Using CircleCI secrets comes with certain challenges and considerations that organizations should be aware of to ensure a secure and efficient CI/CD pipeline.

- **Management of secrets overhead:**  As the number of secrets and contexts grows, managing them effectively can become challenging. Teams need to keep track of which secrets are used where and by whom. It's important to establish clear naming conventions and documentation for secrets and contexts. Also, regularly review and audit secrets to ensure they are up-to-date and properly managed. Consider automating the rotation process to reduce the manual effort required.
- **Access control complexity:** Setting up fine-grained access controls is crucial, but it can become complex as teams and projects scale. Defining and maintaining access permissions for different roles and responsibilities can be challenging. Regularly review and update access controls as team structures evolve. Clearly define roles and responsibilities to determine who needs access to specific secrets. Consider using role-based access control (RBAC) principles to simplify and organize permissions.
- **Integration with external secret management systems:**  Organizations may already have established processes for secrets management using external tools, and integrating these with CircleCI secrets can be complex. Evaluate whether integrating with an external secrets management system is necessary for your organization. If required, explore solutions that seamlessly integrate with CircleCI and provide a unified approach to secrets management. Ensure that the chosen solution aligns with your security and compliance requirements.

Addressing these challenges and considerations requires a thoughtful approach to secrets management, clear communication within the development team, and a commitment to maintaining security best practices throughout the CI/CD pipeline. Regular reviews and updates to your secret management strategy will help ensure a secure and efficient development process.

### Best Practices

Here are five best practices for managing CircleCI secrets:

- **Context-Based management:**  Organize your secrets using [Contexts](https://circleci.com/docs/contexts/) in CircleCI. Group related secrets together in a context, making it easier to manage access controls and permissions. This practice ensures that only authorized personnel have access to specific sets of secrets based on their roles or responsibilities. Note that OIDC can eliminate the need to store long-lived secrets in CircleCI. Learn how to use OIDC with [Pulumi ESC](https://www.pulumi.com/product/esc/) to connect to AWS, GCP, ECR, and more.
- **Fine-grained access controls:**  Set up fine-grained access controls and permissions for each context to restrict who can manage and utilize the secrets within that context. By carefully assigning permissions, you reduce the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive information, enhancing the overall security of your CI/CD process.
- **Avoid hardcoding secrets in configuration files:**  Refrain from hardcoding secret values directly in your configuration files. Instead, reference secrets using the `$SECRET_NAME` syntax. This approach keeps sensitive information separate from the codebase, minimizing the risk of accidental exposure and making it easier to update or rotate secrets without modifying the code.
- **Rotate secrets:** Implement a regular rotation schedule for your secrets, especially for long-lived API keys or credentials. CircleCI provides an easy way to update secrets without modifying the configuration files. Regularly rotating secrets help mitigate the impact of potential security breaches and ensure that compromised credentials are promptly replaced.
- **Auditing and monitoring:** Implement auditing and monitoring mechanisms to track changes and usage of secrets within your CI/CD pipeline. CircleCI provides tools and logs that enable you to monitor when and how secrets are accessed. Regularly review these logs to identify any suspicious activities and promptly address potential security incidents.
